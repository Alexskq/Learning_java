# Basic Java

## Compilation

- Java is a compiled programming language, meaning the code we write in a .java file is transformed into byte code by a compiler before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.

A compiler is a program that translates human-friendly programming languages into other programming languages that computers can execute.

Steps of Java Compilation :  ` File.java -> Compiler -> File.class -> Java Virtual Machime -> Client Program `

The compiling process catches mistakes before the computer runs our code.


## Variable

- int, which stores whole numbers.
- double, which stores bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers.
- boolean, which stores true and false.
- char, which stores single characters using single quotes.
- String, which stores multiple characters using double quotes.
- Static typing, which is one of the safety features of Java.
- Variable naming conventions.

## Operators 

- Addition (+=)
- Subtraction (-=)
- Multiplication (*=)
- Division (/=)
- Modulo (%=)

  #### The order is as follows:

  - Parentheses
  - Exponents
  -  Modulo/Multiplication/Division
  - Addition/Subtraction
